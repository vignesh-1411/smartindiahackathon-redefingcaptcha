Hi Guys.I am Vignesh.
This is my first ever project in SIH for a problem called redefining captcha.Here I used a simple login page using html and styled it using css.Js plays a major role here
when the user enters the username and password and then clicks the login button we detect some of the parameter from the user and identify whether it is a bot or human.

Feel Free to try my project.

Thank you.
